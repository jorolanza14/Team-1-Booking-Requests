## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable)
- Dart SDK (bundled with Flutter)
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter plugin

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the frontend directory
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash   flutter run
   ```

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3000  # For Android emulator
# API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000  # For iOS simulator
```

## API Integration

The app integrates with the Diocese backend API. All API endpoints are configured in `lib/config/api_config.dart`.

### Base URLs
- **Development**: http://10.0.2.2:3000 (Android emulator) or http://127.0.0.1:3000 (iOS simulator)
- **Production**: https://api.diocese-kalookan.com

### Authentication

The app uses JWT-based authentication. Tokens are stored locally and attached to all protected API requests.

## State Management

The app uses Provider for state management. Authentication state, booking data, and other app states are managed through dedicated providers.

## Security

- All API requests use HTTPS in production
- Sensitive data is encrypted locally
- JWT tokens have short expiration times
- Biometric authentication for sensitive operations

## Testing

Unit and widget tests are located in the `test/` directory:

```bash
flutter test
```

Integration tests are located in the `integration_test/` directory:

```bash
